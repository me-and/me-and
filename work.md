# Working with me

Sometimes folk like having a written guide for the best ways of working with
people. Here's one for me. This includes all sorts of interactions, including
but definitely not limited to paid employment!

## Comms

If you're getting in touch with me, in any format, I much prefer to know why
up-front. By chat, [include some context in your first message][nohello]. By
email, please make the topic and what you're looking for clear in the first
paragraph, or ideally in the email subject. In person or in calls, if I don't
already know why we're talking, please give me that information _before_ the
"how are you" type pleasantries; I do like those pleasantries, but if you open
with them, I'm going to be spending that part of the discussion wondering what
you're really after.
