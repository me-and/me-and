# me-and

Hi, I'm Adam.  Depending on why you're here, I'm any or all of:

-   A software engineer in [Microsoft Azure for Operators](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/industries/telecommunications)
-   A contributor to a very wide variety of open source projects, but I'm probably best known as the maintainer of various [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) packages, notably including Git
-   An activist, particularly focused on LGBTQIA+ and disability inclusion
-   A larper, most recognisable as co-head of the General Operations Desk at [Profound Decisions' Empire](https://profounddecisions.co.uk/)

## Pronouns

My thoughts on the correct pronouns to use for me extend well beyond what I can include in a short readme.  For now, use whatever pronouns you'd like for me; if you want the longer version, grab me for a chat some time.

## Talk to me about...

-   Building safer communities in tech and/or corporate spaces
-   Infrastructure, of all kinds
-   Games and game design
