# me-and

Hi, I'm Adam.  Depending on why you're here, I'm any or all of:

-   A senior support engineer in [Alianza](https://www.alianza.com)
-   A contributor to a very wide variety of open source projects, but I'm probably best known as the maintainer of various [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) packages, notably including Git
-   An activist, particularly focused on LGBTQIA+ and disability inclusion
-   A larper, most recognisable as co-head of the Game Operations Desk at [Profound Decisions' Empire](https://profounddecisions.co.uk/)

## Employee disclaimers &c.

Obvious point first: my opinions are my own, I don't speak for my employer.

Possibly less obvious point: I've contributed to a whole range of repositories on GitHub, including several that are owned by Microsoft. At least at time of writing, this has all been in my capacity as an individual OSS contributor; the code I work on for Microsoft is more-or-less all closed source, and I don't have any special access or knowledge from being a Microsoft employee to Microsoft's various open-source projects.

## Pronouns

My thoughts on the correct pronouns to use for me extend well beyond what I can include in a short readme.  For now, use whatever pronouns you'd like for me; if you want the longer version, grab me for a chat some time.

## Talk to me about...

-   Building safer communities in tech and/or corporate spaces
-   Infrastructure, of all kinds
-   Games and game design
